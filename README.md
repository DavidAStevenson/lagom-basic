# Very basic Lagom Samples

This repository contains very, very basic [Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/) framework samples.

As useful as the official samples are, I wanted to put together some even simpler samples of my own to clarify my understanding.

[Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/) is an [open source](https://github.com/lagom/lagom) framework for building reactive microservice systems in Java or Scala.

## Samples index

* KeyValue: a basic implementation of a Key/Value store, using Lagom's Service Descriptor. Set a Value for a Key, and Get a Value for a Key. [Read this](keyvalue/README.md)

## Pre-requisites

As per the official samples, to run these you will need:

1. a [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) client
2. [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) depending on the example.
3. a [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Using these examples

Clone the whole repository, cd to the sample, and check the README.md there.
